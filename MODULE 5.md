## 1: Introduction to Industrial Quality

### What is Quality?
[cite_start]According to Juran's Quality Handbook, quality means "fitness for purpose"[cite: 7]. [cite_start]To be fit for purpose, every good and service must have the right features to satisfy customer needs and must be delivered with few failures[cite: 9]. [cite_start]It must be effective (meeting customer requirements) and efficient (enabling superior business performance)[cite: 10].

[cite_start]If quality is ignored, minor problems can escalate, resulting in millions of dollars lost in revenue, warranty claims, legal actions, and damaged reputations[cite: 51].

### The Total Cost of Quality (CoQ)
[cite_start]To achieve high levels of quality, organizations must balance their investments to ensure the best outcome[cite: 146]. The mathematical framework is:
[cite_start]$CoQ = CoPQ + CoGQ$ [cite: 145]

<img width="3840" height="2160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0998441-a674-4678-ae43-49aec7abb084" />

**1. [cite_start]Cost of Poor Quality (CoPQ):** $CoPQ = CoIF + CoEF$ [cite: 145]
* **Cost of Internal Failure (CoIF):** Occurs before delivery (e.g., reprocessing, rework, scrap)[cite: 151, 153].
* [cite_start]**Cost of External Failure (CoEF):** Occurs after delivery (e.g., warranty claims, recalls, lawsuits)[cite: 157, 160, 161, 162].

**2. [cite_start]Cost of Good Quality (CoGQ):** $CoGQ = CoA + CoP$ [cite: 145]
* **Cost of Appraisal (CoA):** Measuring, evaluating, or auditing products (e.g., incoming inspection, inline measurements)[cite: 167, 169, 170].
* [cite_start]**Cost of Prevention (CoP):** Minimizing failure and appraisal costs (e.g., quality planning, training, FMEA)[cite: 174, 176].

[cite_start]*Rule of Thumb:* $1 spent on Appraisal and Prevention Costs equals $10 saved on Internal and External Failure Costs[cite: 514].

## 2: Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)

[cite_start]FMEA is a systematic, qualitative, team-oriented analytical method designed to identify potential technical risks of failure, their effects, and their causes[cite: 244]. [cite_start]It focuses on *proactive* risk mitigation rather than reactive troubleshooting[cite: 238].

<img width="3840" height="2160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c8a540d-a4bd-42d7-8dd2-5563b8a696cb" />

### DFMEA vs. PFMEA
* **Design FMEA (DFMEA):** Focused on the product and design intent[cite: 283, 286]. *Rule of thumb: Assume that the manufacturing process does not exist*[cite: 270].
* [cite_start]**Process FMEA (PFMEA):** Focused on the manufacturing and assembly process[cite: 288]. [cite_start]*Rule of thumb: Assume that the design is perfect*[cite: 275].

<img width="3840" height="2160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bab06957-908c-4c81-9666-216440acf366" />

### The 7-Step Approach
[cite_start]The AIAG-VDA FMEA process follows seven steps[cite: 361, 362]:
1.  [cite_start]Planning and Preparation [cite: 362]
2.  [cite_start]Structure Analysis [cite: 362]
3.  [cite_start]Function Analysis [cite: 362]
4.  [cite_start]Failure Analysis [cite: 362]
5.  [cite_start]Risk Analysis [cite: 362]
6.  [cite_start]Optimization [cite: 362]
7.  [cite_start]Results Documentation [cite: 362]

<img width="3840" height="2160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5d5035c-5d3e-441b-91da-bae7b4119b84" />

### Risk Scoring (SOD)
[cite_start]Risks are ranked on a scale of 1-10[cite: 336]:
* [cite_start]**Severity (S):** Consequence of the failure (e.g., 10 = Safety risk, 1 = No effect)[cite: 341].
* **Occurrence (O):** Probability of the failure cause (e.g., 10 = No preventive controls, 1 = Error proofed)[cite: 342].
* [cite_start]**Detection (D):** Ability to detect the failure (e.g., 10 = No detection method, 1 = Error proofed)[cite: 344].

[cite_start]These scores determine the **Action Priority (AP)** (High, Medium, or Low), which dictates whether action *must*, *should*, or *could* be taken[cite: 355].

## 3: Production Control Plans

[cite_start]The Control Plan is the "operational expression" of the FMEA[cite: 383]. [cite_start]It is a written description of the control systems and parameters needed to minimize product and process variation[cite: 403]. [cite_start]Actions and controls identified in the FMEA flow directly into the Control Plan[cite: 556].

<img width="3840" height="2160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a39da21a-3b4d-499f-897b-bf54abd902b3" />

### Types of Control Plans
1.  [cite_start]**Prototype:** Dimensional measurements and tests occurring during the prototype build[cite: 524].
2.  [cite_start]**Pre-Launch:** Developed during process design and validation[cite: 526].
3.  [cite_start]**Safe-Launch:** A period of enhanced containment and increased inspection frequency at the start of production[cite: 527, 529].
4.  [cite_start]**Production:** Used for controlling the process during volume manufacturing runs[cite: 531, 533].

## 4: Calibration & Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA)

### Calibration
[cite_start]Calibration involves comparing an unknown measurement device (Device-under-Test) against a known standard under specified conditions[cite: 611, 614, 617].
* **Traceability:** This is the unbroken chain of calibration and associated uncertainty back to a National Standard[cite: 641].
* [cite_start]**Maximum Permissible Error (MPE):** For devices determining product disposition, the MPE should be the OEM spec or 25% of the tightest application specification, whichever is tighter[cite: 693].

<img width="3840" height="2160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22d7fc9d-8c65-46ed-b780-5083a5fa91a5" />

### Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA)
[cite_start]MSA determines if the measurement system can detect "real" differences in a process[cite: 717]. Measurement errors fall into two categories:
* **Location Variation:** Accuracy, Bias, Stability, and Linearity[cite: 721, 722, 723].
* [cite_start]**Width Variation:** Precision, Repeatability, and Reproducibility (GR&R)[cite: 724, 725, 726].

<img width="3840" height="2160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42041cc5-dc03-4cce-92ef-22e85826dac9" />

## 5: Statistical Process Control (SPC)

[cite_start]SPC is a statistical method to control and monitor the quality of a production line, ensuring it operates at its full potential with minimum waste[cite: 734, 736].

<img width="3840" height="2160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a02078a9-f408-42d5-8c9f-a55e40fea779" />

### Types of Variation
* **Common Cause Variation:** Inherent noise in a process due to random effects; it is predictable and stays within statistical limits[cite: 872].
* [cite_start]**Special Cause Variation:** Unexpected glitches or assignable causes that significantly affect a process, making it unstable[cite: 873, 874].

<img width="3840" height="2160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/525147e4-a8d5-4520-8aad-b62fc5f8ed01" />

### Control Charts & Capability
[cite_start]Control charts track observations over time against a Center Line, Upper Control Limit (UCL), and Lower Control Limit (LCL)[cite: 771]. Standard deviation is defined as:
[cite_start]$s_{x}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\overline{x})^{2}}{n-1}}$ [cite: 846]

<img width="3840" height="2160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9589c330-4b7e-4d5e-8bdf-5a93721d00c0" />

[cite_start]Process capability calculates how well the process output meets customer specifications[cite: 915]. 
* Capability Potential ($C_p$):
    [cite_start]$C_p = \frac{USL - LSL}{6\sigma}$ [cite: 917]
* Process Capability Index ($C_{pk}$):
    $C_{pk} = \min(\frac{USL - \bar{x}}{3\sigma}, \frac{\bar{x} - LSL}{3\sigma})$ [cite: 917]

A process is considered "good" when $C_p > 1.33$[cite: 917].

## 6: Fault Detection Control (FDC) & Run-to-Run (R2R)

To meet the demands of leading-edge manufacturing, Advanced Process Control (APC) replaces traditional manual intervention with real-time process control[cite: 930].

* [cite_start]**FDC (Fault Detection & Classification):** Collects real-time trace data from equipment sensors (e.g., temperature, pressure, vibration) to monitor health and detect abnormalities[cite: 937, 939, 940, 943]. [cite_start]When a fault is detected, it triggers an Out-of-Control-Plan (OCAP)[cite: 948].
* **R2R (Run-to-Run Control):** Modifies the process recipe between machine runs using metrology feedback[cite: 1054]. This minimizes process drift, reduces variability, and ensures a stable output[cite: 1054, 1101].
